            <p>The Black Star Square in Accra, Ghana, is a prominent public space and a symbol of the country's independence. Also known as the Independence Square, it was inaugurated in 1961 to commemorate Ghana's liberation from colonial rule in 1957. The square features notable landmarks such as the Black Star Monument, a large statue with a black star at its top, representing Ghana's freedom and unity. It also hosts key national events, including military parades and independence celebrations, making it a central site for national pride and patriotism.</p>
